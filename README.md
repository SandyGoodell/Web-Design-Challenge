# Web-Design-Challenge

* Create visualization dashboard wesite using visualizations from the WeatherPy assignment. Specifically, we'll be plotting weather data.

* In building this dashboard, individual pages were created for each plot and a means by which we can navigate between them. These pages will contain the visualizations and their corresponding explanations.

* It has a landing page, a page where there are comparison of all of the plots, and another page where we can view the data used to build them.
